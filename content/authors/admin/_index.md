I am a Ph.D student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Arizona State University. My main research interests are in Computer Vision, Deep Learning and AI for health care. I am advised by [Dr Pavan K Turaga](https://pavanturaga.com/). I am also fortunate to be advised by [Dr Jayaraman J Thiagarajan](https://jjthiagarajan.com/) who is a computer Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
